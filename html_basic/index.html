			<h2>Base Index highlighlight</h2>
			<p>In base index you start by describing the document using the !DOCTYPE title. This allows your machine to know what language you are intending to use in the document ie html, js etc</p>
			<p>The second part is defining what human language you are using and in this case this is English</p>
			<h3>using the style feature</h3>
			<p>In within the head section, you can do some basic styling such as trying to establish the background color, text color, font size and etc</p>
			<p>Remember this part is abit tricky as it involves multiple commands which can be misspelled or done wrong. However you can edit the Navigation section using nav, nav a and nav a:hover</p>
